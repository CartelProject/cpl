Terms and Conditions:
=====================

0. Definitions. This "License" includes the GPLv3, and is meant to be a supplement to the GPLv3.

1. Do whatever you want with the code, just don't:
	1(a). Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name
	1(b). Selling the unmodified original with no productive work done, including name-changes, one-liners and such.
	1(c). Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content, including viruses, keyloggers, and other harmful content. Harmful content can include sexual and/or violent content, or content with manipulative, dishonest, slanderous, unethical or other harmful material.
	1(d). Selling a project with educational purposes without consulting the original creator. 

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a beer or a pizza.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching is not right. Fix the problem yourself or submit a bug report, so that the original creator can attempt to fix the problem.

	3(a). BUG REPORTING ETIQUETTE:
		a.  First and foremost, understand that for the vast majority of people, this is a hobby, not a job. It may take some time for your issue to be resolved. Being a jerk or bossy is likely to get you banned or at the least have your issue dismissed.
		b.  Write in clear, concise manner what the issue is with steps to reproduce
    			Bad: My phone is broken, help!
    			Good: Whenever I open YouTube after a clean flash, it force closes.
		c.  Explain what you have done. A developer should not have to ask what has already been attempted.
		d.  Provide any scenarios where it did work (was it working in a previous update, etc.)
		e.  If you are technically inclined, provide commits that are either the issue or will resolve the issue. Developers love having a solution presented for them.
		f.  Refer to this document to know more how to: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html
